# What is this?

It is exactly what it looks like. A writing system based off [Cyrillish](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/cyrillisch.htm) that aims to be a more complete writing system. This repo is to store the keyboard layouts in order to type in this writing system.

# How to 

For the macOS keybaord layout, simply download the [layout](https://codeload.github.com/ArkieSoft/Arkian-Cyrillic/zip/refs/tags/1.0) and unzip the folder. Move ```Arkian-Cyrillic.bundle``` to ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts/```. Then go to Settings, then Keybaord. Under Text Input, click on "Edit" for Input Sources. Click on the "+" button, and scroll to "English(Cyrillic)" then click "Add". This will import the custom layout and it will be selectable with the other keyboard layouts that are also enabled.
